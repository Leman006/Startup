## 🚩 The Problem
Traditional smart-agro platforms (like CropX or John Deere) are often unaffordable for small-scale farmers, costing between **$300 and $5000+**.
* **Water Inefficiency:** Up to 40% water loss due to inefficient irrigation (FAO).
* **High Barrier to Entry:** Existing systems require expensive sensors and complex maintenance.
* **Soil Degradation:** Over-fertilization costs farmers money and damages soil health.
* **Operational Complexity:** Farmers often lack the technical expertise for high-end data platforms.

## ✨ Our Solution: MyGarden
**MyGarden** is a software-only SaaS product designed to democratize precision agriculture.
* **Digital Irrigation Journal:** Simplified tracking of water usage by plot, zone, and crop type.
* **Automated Recommendations:** Data-driven advice powered by **OpenWeather API** and **GIS/FAO soil maps**.
* **Water Intelligence:** Precise calculations of water needs ($ET_0$, $K_c$, and soil factors) without physical sensors.
